# New Features!

  - Extremely fast detection on GPU as well as good inference time on cpu 
  - Even more accurate models.
### How to use

Download weights from the following [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10QvwT857wyShDlkZ9JWOJ1FGrL963OCU?usp=sharing)

If you have a faster computer use yolov3 weight but if your machine is not fast or you want to use cpu use yolov3-tiny.weights
