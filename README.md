# First CSGO deep learning aim assist! 2020 Update!

This is a CSGO aim assist that is not detectable. With the new 2020 update anyone can enjoy better aim. New release is coming in a few days with new faster and more accurate models to detect more enemies!


# How does it work?

This program grabs your screen and moves mouse according to the deep learning model prediction.


## Why is it undetectable?

NO FILES ARE BEING CHANGED. This aim assist doesn't change any CSGO files 

## How to use? 

1. [Download the latest version of CSGO_object_detection.rar](https://github.com/kir486680/csgo_aim/releases)
2. Make sure that you have the latest .pb file
3. Run CSGO_object_detection.exe
